### LOUD AUDIO WARNING, USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK

## python setup stuff

ok so download the latest version of python (please make sure you install it in PATH, otherwise for the next step instead of typing ```pip install``` you need to type ```py -m pip install```)

then umm open terminal and type these commands:

```pip install realtimestt``` (this lets the program type what you're saying)

```pip install pyttsx3``` (this lets the program read out the reason for your demise)

```pip install pygame``` (this lets the program **Public Execution**)

## actual program setup stuff

great! now download both files, preferrably into one standalone folder. you can replace the audio file with whatever you want as long as it is named "audio.wav". 

close your terminal, open a new one, and cd into your folder (for example because my folder path is ```C:\Users\armaan\Desktop\Projects\noLetterChallenge```, i would enter this command: ```cd desktop\projects\noletterchallenge```)

now enter ```py challenge.py```

there may be a lot of messages but don't worry it just means a lot of the stuff i used was old and deprecated, just wait until it asks you what you want the trigger to be, enter it, and then wait until it says "speak now"

now everything works yay!!!

### i highly recommend using this program with headphones on, because if you are on something like a laptop which may hear its own output, it may retrigger
